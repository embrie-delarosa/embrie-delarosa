## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Embrie Dela Rosa, passionate and curious student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS). I hold an Associate Degree in Computer Technology, which laid the foundation for my growing interest in technology, systems, and software development. I'm always open to new learnings and constantly looking for opportunities to grow, improve, and explore different areas within the tech field.

I'm currently focused on expanding my knowledge in the said field. I believe that continuous learning is key to becoming not just a better developer, but a well-rounded problem solver.

I'm always open for collaboration, learning opportunities, and connecting with like-minded individuals in tech. Whether itâ€™s a small project or just sharing knowledge, I believe every step adds up to something greater.
